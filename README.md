# web-frontend

### Update Apr 2024
Weblink is not working as I have taken down the backend services (previously running on AWS) to save cost. If you would like to check out the app, you may consider taking a look at the [backend](https://github.com/interngowhere/web-backend) repo and spinning up the containers from there.
